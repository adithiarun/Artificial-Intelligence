## Minimax Algorithm and Alpha-Beta Pruning

The objective of this project is to create adversarial agents that can beat other agents in a game called 2 Queens Isolation. In this game, there are two players, four game pieces and a 7-by-7 grid of squares.
At the beginning of the game, the first player places both the pieces on any two different squares. From that point on, the players alternate turns moving both the pieces like a Queen in chess (any number of open squares vertically,
horizontally, or diagonally). When the piece is moved, the square that was previously occupied is blocked. That square can not be used for the remainder of the game. The piece can not move through blocked squares.
The first player who is unable to move any one of the queens loses.
