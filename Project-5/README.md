## Expectation Maximization

For this project, K Means Clustering, Gaussian Mixture Models, and a metric called Bayesian Information Criterion are implemented.

### K-means Clustering
This is an unsupervised learning algorithm which groups datapoints based on their similarity to each other.

### Gaussian Mixture Models
